# Everchess App Demo - Hackathon Submission

## Hello Judges! Thank you for taking the time to view the Everchess repo and README.md file.

For week 1 of the hackathon, I focused on finalizing Research. Week 2-4, I finalized the design.

### This everchess code repo represents a visual design demo of the Everchess app and ecosystem.

Written mostly in React and Next.js, this foundational design will serve as the UI/UX mock-up for me to build the full Everchess app and ecosystem in React Native + Expo among other stacks to fulfill the vision of Everchess being a cross-platform app available for both PCs and phones.

### The Everchess App and Ecosystem will have various Solana-based technologies integrated.

1) NFTs as 3D Chess Sets. (Only one Core Collection of NFTs. Rest will be standard skins)
2) Staking benefits for Chess Set NFTs. (In-game boosts + rewards among other things) 
3) USDC Rewards for Tournaments and Wagers (with thorough anti-cheating measures)

### Next steps for me are:

1) Assess the potential of a grant for Everchess to be used for development and 3D asset designs.
2) Dive into the full development of the Everchess app and ecosystem with the official tech stack.
3) As I progress through the development, I'll be creating/designing the 3D Assets for Everchess.
4) Continue to build in public, sharing past updates as I adapt and make meaningful progress.
5) Once we're closer to launch, ramp up content, marketing, growth efforts. Then, LAUNCH.
