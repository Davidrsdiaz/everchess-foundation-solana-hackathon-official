## WebSocket Event Propagation

WebSocket events are crucial for real-time updates across the application:

1. **Game Events**: Match found, game state updates, game results
2. **Progression Events**: XP gained, level-up, mission completed
3. **Market Events**: Item purchased, limited item stock updates
4. **Social Events**: Friend online, challenge received, tournament starting

These events are received by the WebSocket client and dispatched to the appropriate components using the application's state management system.

## State Management

The application uses a combination of React Context and local component state:

1. **Auth Context**: User authentication state
2. **Queue Context**: Matchmaking queue status
3. **Status Context**: Online status and notifications
4. **Sidebar Context**: Navigation state

These contexts allow components to access shared state without prop drilling and ensure consistent data across the application.

## API Integration Points

Each page has specific API integration points:

| Page | Primary API Endpoints | WebSocket Events |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Dashboard | `/api/users/me/stats`, `/api/missions/daily` | `mission:completed`, `xp:earned` |
| Play | `/api/matchmaking/queue`, `/api/games` | `match:found`, `game:move`, `game:result` |
| Battlepass | `/api/battlepass/progress`, `/api/battlepass/rewards` | `battlepass:level_up`, `reward:claimed` |
| Chess Sets | `/api/users/me/inventory`, `/api/chess-sets` | `inventory:updated` |
| Market | `/api/market/items`, `/api/market/purchase` | `market:item_purchased`, `market:stock_update` |
| Profile | `/api/users/me/profile`, `/api/users/me/games` | `profile:achievement_unlocked`, `profile:rating_update` |
| Ranking | `/api/leaderboard`, `/api/tournaments` | `tournament:started`, `leaderboard:updated` |
